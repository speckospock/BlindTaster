There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Blind Taster
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.


## Sub-Heading ##
  For servers, sommeliers, and wine enthusiasts
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

## Summary ##
  Blind Taster allows servers, sommeliers, and wine enthusiasts to develop their palates together.
  A manager enters product information (vintage, varietal, producer, etc.), defines the timing of the
  taste test, and decides whether the tasting will be blind or not. Then, Blind Taster generates a link
  for the manager to send out, where participants can record their tasting notes within the time defined.
  At the end of time, the results will be collected and displayed, so that the everybody can discuss the wine,
  and managers can track the palate development of their servers.
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

## Problem ##
  When developing one's wine palate, blind tasting is essential. Passing the Sommelier exams require one to master
  the skill, and often results are recorded on paper or on self-created spreadsheets/docs. There's no easy way
  to run analytics on problem areas, check one's results against one's peers, or track one's progress.
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

## Solution ##
  Blind Taster allows managers, servers, sommeliers, and wine enthusiasts to develop their palates in a
  trackable, standardized, simple way. One person creates a test, and the link is sent out to any number of
  participants. The manager can track servers and sommeliers' progress, to help shape their development
  program. Participants can sign in and record their results, so that they can track their palate development
  and centralize their wine tasting journal.
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

## Quote from You ##
  "Blind Taster takes the guesswork out of passing your Sommelier exams and lets managers create tailored palate
  development plans for their servers and sommeliers"
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

## How to Get Started ##
  Head to the Blind Taster site and click "Create Test" to get started! To save and track results, sign in with
  Google.
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

## Customer Quote ##
  "Blind Taster helped me prepare myself for the Advanced Sommelier test. I passed the test, got a raise,
  and had a ton of fun doing it!"
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  Go to the Blind Taster site and start tasting!
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
